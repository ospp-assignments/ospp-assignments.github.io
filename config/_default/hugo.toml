# Relearn Theme
# These options are specific to the Relearn theme.

#++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Variants
# These options set your color variant.

# Used color variants.
# Default: "auto"
# This sets one or more color variants, available to your readers to choose
# from. You can either set a single value eg. "zen-light" or an array like
# [ "neon", "learn" ]. If the array has more than one entry, a variant selector
# is shown in the lower part of the menu. The first entry in the array is the
# default variant, used for first time visitors.
# The theme ships with the following variants: "auto", "relearn-bright",
# "relearn-light", "relearn-dark", "zen-light", "zen-dark", "neon", "learn",
# "blue", "green", "red". The auto variant is somewhat special. See the
# option for themeVariantAuto below.
# You can also define your own variants. See the docs how this works. Also,
# the docs provide an interactive theme generator to help you with this task.

themeVariant = ["dark", "light"]

# The color variants used for auto mode.
# Default: [ "relearn-light", "relearn-dark" ], overwritten by the first
# two non-auto options of your `themeVariant` option if present.
# The auto variant defines how your site adjusts to your selected OS settings
# for light/dark mode. The first array element is the variant for light mode,
# the second for dark mode.
# themeVariantAuto = ["dark", "light"]

# Default: false
# If shown, a Home button will appear below the search bar and the main menu.
# It links to your the home page of the current language.
disableLandingPageButton = true

# Hide copy-to-clipboard for inline code.
# Default: false
# This removes the copy-to-clipboard button from your inline code.
disableInlineCopyToClipBoard = true

# The initial expand state of submenus.
# Default: not set
# This controls whether submenus will be expanded (true), or collapsed (false)
# in the menu. If not set, the first menu level is set to false, all others
# levels are set to true. This can be overridden in the page's frontmatter.
# If the displayed page has submenus, they will always been displayed expanded
# regardless of this option.
alwaysopen = false

# Shows expander for submenus.
# Default: false
# If set to true, a submenu in the sidebar will be displayed in a collapsible
# tree view and a clickable expander is set in front of the entry.
collapsibleMenu = true

# Shows checkmarks for visited pages of the main menu.
# Default: false
# This also causes the display of the `Clear History` entry in the lower part
# of the menu to remove all checkmarks. The checkmarks will also been removed
# if you regenerate your site as the ids are not stable.
showVisitedLinks = true

# Generate link URLs the Hugo way.
# Default: false
# If set to true, the theme behaves like a standard Hugo installation and
# appends no index.html to prettyURLs. As a trade off, your build project will
# not be servable from the file system.
disableExplicitIndexURLs = true

##### TWEAKS BY KARL

# Tweak by Karl. Don't show chapter numbers for the the chapter archetype. 
# Default: false
# If set to true, the chapther number will not be rendered for the chapter 
# archetype. 
# This new logic has been added in my
# layouts/partials/archetypes/chapter/article.html theme relearn override.
